<u>Getting started</u>   
* Why we use R
  - Reproduciblity & clarity (= publications, supervisors, colleagues)   
  - used by many disciplines to analyse their data = big community available to help you and large number of extensions(packages)    
  - scalable to deal with ever larger data-sets
  - ggplot package (later) can create quality graphs for publication (search 'R graph gallery')
  - Free to use and on many types of computer & so lowers barriers to access your work   
* Rstudio is a set of tools (all in one place) to help you write R programs
* Working directory is important concept to get across and not understanding it can be a <u>__MAJOR__</u> cause of problems later on in the course!
* Expanding your knowledge on how to use R    
  - Rstudio Help (the 'go to' place)
  - ?, args() function, ?? -> solve different types of question about R   
  - Where on the web -> fora better than Google search   
  - How on the web -> helping them help you (info about data, version of R, computer, version of packages)
    
<u>Introduction to R programming</u>   
* We use objects to store values for later usage.
* Introduce over-writing value of objects.
* Concept of functions & parameters - use the args() function to get help here (revisit topic)    
* Everything is a vector
  - different types of data - how does a program detect type of a vector?
